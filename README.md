## Inspiration
With most schools, preschools, and childcare in the nation shut down because of the pandemic, a lot of parents are faced with the problem of working from home while caring for their kids. Some are lucky enough to have older students that still have the structure of a classroom through Zoom calls with their teachers.

I noticed a lot of my friends with younger children posting on social media about activities that kept their kids occupied for **x** amount of time. One mom posted a video and craft idea and captioned it with "This kept _so-and-so_ busy for half an hour! It was the perfect amount of time for a quick meeting call."

I thought it would be a great idea to curate a list of activities for parents to choose from and help ease the stress of working at home with young kids.

## What it does
Users are able to select an activity for each block of time (30 min increments). The user can choose activity types (right now it's limited by Off-screen, On-Screen, Creative, Physical, and Learning) and can filter by multiple types.

## What's next for Baby Zoomers
I want to continue working on this and make use of external API's to link to the activities. I also think it would be useful to have calendar integration. I also want to incorporate more testing.
